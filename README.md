# Space Master: Find Invisibles (A Mobile Game that is Disabled Friendly!)
A classic space shooter game for Everyone, even the Visually Impaired (blind) by chris._.sin

## Description
***Early Access***

Enemies of Humanity, the Invisibles, are using advanced camouflage tech to hide from our vision! We need your help to locate them, Space Ranger.  Use you Ai augmented Brain's mutated senses to locate the enemies, upon locating long press to fire the laser and destroy them!

The Visually Impaired people might have to depend on their Android TalkBack's long press gesture for long press, that is to double tap and hold, in order to fire the laser upon locating.

Note:-
In case haptics/vibration is not working for you, make sure it is turned on from: Settings>Sound&Vibration>Touch Vibration OR in some phones from: Accessibility>Vibration&Haptics>Touch Feedback

Various methods of locating the "Invisibles" are made available to you, such as haptics/vibrations, Audio and visual color change of Navigation and Status bar.
